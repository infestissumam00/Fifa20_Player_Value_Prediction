# Fifa20_Player_Value_Prediction

Football (Soccer) in the modern times has become much complicated, than it ever was. For clubs all around the world, it’s not just about playing your heart out in the field, but also perform well in the transfer markets, to snap up the right talent and players for their sides, at the right price. Over the past few years we have observed a serious inflation in player values and some exuberant release clauses (price inserted in a player’s contract with his/her current club for which he/she can be bought by another club).

As a result of this, a many clubs end up paying a lot more for a player whose talent and performances on the field fail to justify his/her price tag. A similar problem is faced by the club selling a player, where they fail to realise his/her potential, and let him/her go for a price which was way less than the actual price they should have asked for.
We shall try to solve this as a regression problem using Deep Learning. We will be making use of the fast.ai’s tabular module to predict a player’s value based on his/her skill and personality attributes.
